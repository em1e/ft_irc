### **Project Structure**

#### **Key Components**
1. **Server Setup**
   - Socket creation and configuration.
   - Handling incoming client connections.

2. **Protocol Implementation**
   - Parsing and handling IRC commands.
   - Ensuring compliance with the required IRC features (e.g., nickname, username, channels).

3. **Client Interaction**
   - Managing client sessions.
   - Handling user input/output and broadcasting messages.

4. **Non-blocking I/O**
   - Using `poll()` or an equivalent mechanism for non-blocking operations.

5. **Channel Management**
   - Implementing commands like `JOIN`, `KICK`, `INVITE`, `TOPIC`, `MODE`.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Managing partial data, errors in communication, and ensuring stability.

### **Team Roles and Responsibilities**

#### **Person 1: Core Server Infrastructure**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Design and implement the server's core logic:
     - Socket creation (`socket`, `bind`, `listen`).
     - Accepting and managing client connections.
     - Setting up file descriptors in non-blocking mode.
  2. Develop the event loop:
     - Use `poll()` (or an equivalent) to handle I/O.
     - Track active connections and manage events.
  3. Handle disconnections and cleanup of resources.

- **Deliverables**:
  - A working server skeleton that accepts connections and processes I/O events.
  - Clear documentation on how the event loop works.

#### **Person 2: Protocol and Commands**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement the IRC protocol:
     - Parse client messages.
     - Handle commands like `NICK`, `USER`, `JOIN`, `PRIVMSG`.
  2. Define and manage user sessions:
     - Associate clients with nicknames and usernames.
     - Maintain session states.
  3. Implement the channel system:
     - Allow clients to join and leave channels.
     - Forward messages to all users in a channel.
  4. Implement operator commands:
     - `KICK`, `INVITE`, `TOPIC`, `MODE`.

- **Deliverables**:
  - Command parser and handler.
  - Session and channel management modules.
  - Basic functionality for sending and receiving messages.

#### **Person 3: Client Interaction and Testing**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Develop client interaction logic:
     - Handle message input and output (send/recv).
     - Manage message formatting and aggregation (handling partial messages).
  2. Test with a reference IRC client:
     - Ensure compatibility with a standard client (e.g., `HexChat`, `irssi`).
     - Conduct robust testing (e.g., partial data, high latency).
  3. Error handling:
     - Handle malformed messages and disconnections gracefully.
     - Ensure the server remains stable under various conditions.

- **Deliverables**:
  - A client interaction module that processes data correctly.
  - A test suite to validate server functionality.

### **Work Plan and Milestones**

#### **Week 1: Planning and Design**
- Discuss and finalize the architecture.
- Define interfaces for collaboration (e.g., data structures for sessions and channels).
- Create a Git repository and establish coding standards.

#### **Week 2: Core Server Infrastructure**
- Person 1: Complete the basic server setup and event loop.
- Person 2: Start defining IRC commands and the protocol structure.
- Person 3: Set up a test environment and familiarize with the reference client.

#### **Week 3: Command and Protocol Integration**
- Person 1: Enhance the server with non-blocking read/write.
- Person 2: Implement basic commands (`NICK`, `USER`, `PRIVMSG`, `JOIN`).
- Person 3: Test basic functionality with real clients and refine error handling.

#### **Week 4: Advanced Features**
- Person 1: Optimize the event loop for stability under load.
- Person 2: Add operator commands (`KICK`, `INVITE`, `TOPIC`, `MODE`).
- Person 3: Conduct comprehensive testing and finalize compatibility.

#### **Week 5: Finalization**
- Integrate all components and resolve any issues.
- Review code for cleanliness and compliance.
- Prepare the Makefile and documentation.

### **Collaboration Tips**
- Use a shared Git repository for version control.
- Schedule regular team meetings to sync progress and address blockers.
- Use a ticketing system (e.g., Trello, Jira) to track tasks and milestones.
- Maintain detailed documentation for each module.
